# Sudoku-Suite
Sudoku, but 3-dimensional




## Description
Imagine a Sudoku puzzle, but like, 9 of them stacked up back to back. 

This is the idea behind the “Sudokube”, where the 9x9x9 puzzle has to be solved while following the rules in all 3 dimensions.

The project itself is named "Sudoku Suite" as the intention is to let users create both 3D and 2D puzzles.




## Current State

As of right now, the structures are in place for a 9x9x9 puzzle, but the generation algorithm still needs work.

As a substitute, single-number placements have been implemented, and one can see empty spots where none of the options can exist.

A backtracking solution will be needed in order to complete the puzzle generation.
